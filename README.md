# Wild-Life
## Interactive Game of Life
This is my small lockdown-weekend project - my tribute to John Horton Conway.
This is an interactive version of Conwayâ€™s Life Game, written in Python. It allows placing different life forms using mouse clicks while game is running.

### What you need:

-	Python 3.8 or newer (should work on 3.6+, but did not test it)
-	Numpy (pip install numpy)
-	OpenCV (pip install opencv-python)

### How to run it:
On Windows just execute python3.exe wild_life.py
In theory this code should run fine also on Linux, but I did not test it.

### How use it:

-	Mouse-click anywhere to insert species
-	Mouse-click on the species list in the bottom to select species to be inserted
-	1, 2, 3, 4 keys to change color map
-	Esc to exit

All configuration parameters are stored in first part of wild_life.py file.
